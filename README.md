### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a DevOps engineer at [Nordic Semicondictor](https://nordicsemi.com) that grew out of a Hardware Engineer and here I keep my spare time projects. Proud (and tired) homelab owner that keeps shrinking with me.  I have a passion for webdesign, networking, system administration and DevOps. You can see more on my website [kibk.net](https://kibk.net).

Have a wonderful day!
